# Getting started

React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution written entirely in JavaScript (so you can read and understand all of the source), on top of powerful native primitives.

> 语法分析：第一句是典型的`主系表结构`，其中`born from the React Native community's need...`是表语，它与系动词`is`一起构成谓语。`need for obj` 是一个名词短语，表示`所需之物`，这里无论是`need`还是`need for ...`以及所接对象都是名词性质。
这里的`yet`表示汉语`又`。

Before you commit to using React Navigation for your project, you might want to read the anti-pitch — it will help you to understand the tradeoffs that we have chosen along with the areas where we consider the library to be deficient currently.

> 语法分析：`Before...` 是一个时间状语从句，`commit to doing` 表示确定做某事。`...the tradeoffs that we have chosen along with the areas where...`。在这里`that...`是`tradeoffs`这个名词的定语从句。`the tradeoffs that we have chosen`也就是我们所选择的利弊权衡。`to understand `在这里作定语（对you进行说明）。

## What to expect

If you're already familiar with React Native then you'll be able to get moving with React Navigation quickly! If not, you may want to read sections 1 to 4 (inclusive) of React Native Express first, then come back here when you're done.

What follows within the Fundamentals section of this documentation is a tour of the most important aspects of React Navigation. It should cover enough for you to know how to build your typical small mobile application, and give you the background that you need to dive deeper into the more advanced parts of React Navigation.

## Installation

```
yarn add react-navigation
```
