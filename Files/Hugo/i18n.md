# 多语言的实现

首先需要在配置文件中进行相关语言的配置，我们以`config.toml`为例：

```toml
DefaultContentLanguage = "en"
copyright = "Everything is mine"

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    baseURL = "https://example.com"
    languageName = "English"
    title = "In English"
    weight = 2
  [languages.fr]
    baseURL = "https://example.fr"
    languageName = "Français"
    title = "En Français"
    weight = 1

[params]
  [params.navigation]
    help = "Help"
```

Anything not defined in a [languages] block will fall back to the global value for that key (e.g., copyright for the English [en] language). This also works for params, as demonstrated witgh help above: You will get the value Aide in French and Help in all the languages without this parameter set.

With the configuration above, all content, sitemap, RSS feeds, paginations, and taxonomy pages will be rendered below / in English (your default content language) and then below /fr in French.
